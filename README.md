Folders:

- animations : Here I have placed all animations produced in the notebook - you should not need to run any of the animation producing code in the notebook in order to see these.

- figures : static images produced for both the reports and slides

- data : Here all data used to run the notebook is provided. The raw source data for all the flight information is not provided as it would be too large.
--- network : we've provided the processed flight data in the network subdirectory. This has a table of airport information, as well as csv files for each month that correspond to the edges used to build the network.
--- covid19 : timeseries data sourced from John Hopkins University. We only use the confirmed cases from this dataset, but there is more information regarding recovered cases and deaths, and much more data online.
--- gadm : these are manually downloaded shapefiles for australian state and chinese province borders. The US state borders and global country borders are downloaded via the natural earth api in the notebook itself.


We also include in the base directory:
- Presentation Slides
- PDF Report
- Notebook Submission .ipynb file


Python package installations + note on animations:
All packages used to run the code should be listed in the first cell of the notebook. Most you sh ould have already, however it is likely you will need to install cartopy. I have commnted out the import of cartopy, but if you do want to run any code related to producing the map visualisations and animations (which you shouldnt need to), simply install the package and import the file.

You may or may not run into issues when exporting the file to disk as it requires installation of 'ffmpeg", but you can just display the animations locally in the Jupyter Notebook (although it takes a little longer to run than simply saving to disk).
